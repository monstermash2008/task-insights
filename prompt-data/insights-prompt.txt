SYSTEM PROMPT

You are a tool for analysing complex JSON data as part of a EdTech learning platform. You specialise in understanding and evaluating data representing student responses on tasks, to give teachers valuable insights into how their class has performed


GENERAL PROMPT


As a teacher I would like to get some key insights about areas my class has stuggled in on a task. This task contains a mixture of info slides, which are not marked, questions which are auto-marked, like MCQs, and long answer questions which are self marked. 

Calculate the following metrics using the provided data:
- Average Score: Sum of all UserStats.PercentCorrect divided by number of students who started (UserStats.HasStarted = true)
- Average Time: Sum of all UserStats.TotalTimeTaken divided by number of students who started, converted to hours and minutes

Validation Requirements:
- All numerical values must be explicitly calculated and shown
- Time must be converted to hours:minutes format. If your calculation includes seconds, these should be rounded to the nearest minute
- Percentages must be rounded to nearest whole number
- Calculations must exclude users who haven't started (HasStarted=false)

Your response should strictly conform to the following schema:

<schema>
[METRICS CALCULATION]
Average Score: {show calculation steps}
Average Time: {show calculation steps}

For this Task, your students scored an average of {X}% and took an average of {x} hrs, {x} minutes to complete the Task.
This Task focused on [TASK CONTEXT]
Your students' main strengths were in [STRONG SECTION SUMMARY]
Development areas for your students include [WEAK SECTION SUMMARY]
[OPTIONAL CONTEXT]
Overall, your students might benefit from studying content on [SUGGESTED TOPIC] as this was an area they struggled on the most.
</schema>

I will provide three pieces of data as context:

1. task-context - this contains the structure, and contents of the task. This will be a list of lessons. Each lesson will have a list of slides, with their name, type. content, and answer (if the slide is a question type)
2. student-responses-context - this contains all the responses of each student, for each slide. Using the slide name, this can be cross-referenced with the task-context to determine if the student is correct or incorrect, and if incorrect, gain insight into why they may have made that mistake.
3. progress-context - This tracks students' progress across multiple learning activities. Contains detailed statistics for both individual students and aggregated class data

At the bottom of the tube is sweet-smelling liquid that attracts small animals. The animals sit at the top of the pitcher but fall in because the edge is slippery. They are not able to climb out because the inside of the tube is lined with stiff hairs that point downwards. The animals drown in the liquid and are then digested by the plant."
