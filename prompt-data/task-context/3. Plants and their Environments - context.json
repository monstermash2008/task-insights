      "explanation": "All plants need sunlight to grow. Some plants have adapted to grow taller than others. When they do, they have access to a lot of sunlight, and cast a shadow over the plants below them. This limits the amount of sunlight that shorter plants can receive, affecting their growth and survival."

      "explanation": "For this question, you may have written about either venus flytraps, sundews, pitcher plants or bladderworts. Here is an example answer on pitcher plants!\n\nPitcher plants are made up of a leaf curled up into a tube, shaped like a pitcher. At the bottom of the tube is sweet-smelling liquid that attracts small animals. The animals sit at the top of the pitcher but fall in because the edge is slippery. They are not able to climb out because the inside of the tube is lined with stiff hairs that point downwards. The animals drown in the liquid and are then digested by the plant."
