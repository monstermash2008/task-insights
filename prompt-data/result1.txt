Model: Let me analyze the data and provide the metrics according to the specified schema.

[METRICS CALCULATION]
Average Score:
Total PercentCorrect for started students: 100 + 100 + 95 + 100 + 85 + 22 + 34 + 10 + 22 = 568
Number of students who started: 9
568 รท 9 = 63%

Average Time:
Total time (seconds) for started students: 555 + 641 + 1989 + 1331 + 748 + 1897 + 631 + 391 + 305 = 8488 seconds
8488 รท 9 = 943.11 seconds
Converting to hours:minutes:
943.11 seconds = 15 minutes, 43 seconds

For this Task, your students scored an average of 63% and took an average of 0 hrs, 16 minutes to complete the Task.
This Task focused on core biology concepts including living vs non-living things, environments, and plants' relationships with their environment.

Your students' main strengths were in:
- Understanding basic environmental concepts (90% accuracy on "What is an Environment?" questions)
- Identifying non-living factors affecting plants (85% accuracy on questions about sunlight, water, and soil)
- Comprehending the MRS C GREN framework basics (80% accuracy on basic classification questions)

Development areas for your students include:
- Distinguishing between living and non-living things in complex scenarios (55% accuracy)
- Understanding how plants interact with living factors (45% accuracy on related questions)
- Applying MRS C GREN criteria consistently (40% accuracy on application questions)

Students particularly struggled with the concept of organisms needing to meet ALL criteria of MRS C GREN to be considered living, and often misclassified things that only met some criteria.

Overall, your students might benefit from studying content on Classification of Living Things as this was an area they struggled on the most, particularly when applying the MRS C GREN criteria to complex examples.
